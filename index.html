	"What should you always do when answering a question involving a calculation?, Write all my working down clearly because some of the marks are for showing how I get the answer, Just write down the answers as it saves me time, The answer on its own is enough to get all the marks, The answer proves I know enough to get all the marks",
	"If you use a calculator to work something out what should you always do?,Write down the steps you did on the calculator as your working because you could get marks for it,Just write down the answer because calculator working does not count as real working out, Leave gaps in my working because it is on the calculator screen, Just write down the answers because on a calculator question I do not need to show working out",
	"When doing the calculator paper what should you do?,Check even the easiest calculations that you did in your head with the calculator just in case you made a mistake, Only use the calculator when something is really tricky to do in my head, Leave the calculator and only use it as a lsat resort, Try and do it all without the calculator as an extra challenge",
	"When doing the calculator paper what should you do?,Use the calculator to work things out and check my answers!, Use the calculator as a back-up, Leave the calculator and only use it as a last resort, Try and do it all without the calculator as a extra challenge",
	"If you know you messed up the first part of a question what should you do?,Use the answer I get in the next part because even if it is wrong I will get the marks for the rest of the question if I do the rest of it right, Leave the rest of the question as there is no point in carrying on, Put a line through it and leave it, Just move on to another question",
	"If you finish early what should you do?,Go back and look at questions I struggled with - I might be able to write something that gets me an extra mark, Sit there and play with the calculator to pass the time, Ask if I can go now, Sit there doodling on the paper to relieve the boredom",
	"When looking at a question with lots of text what should you do?, Read through each part carefully and underline important numbers, Move on to another question that is easier to read, Skip the boring bits and read the last sentence, Use up some time colouring in the picture as that will make it look like I am doing something",
	"What is a good idea before writing down a number you just worked out?,Give the number a quick sanity check. Does it look right or is the number either way too low or much too high?, Just write it down without thinking too much about it - if it's wrong it's wrong, It must be right if the calculator says so, Write it down and move on - the sooner I finish the sooner I can get out of here",
	"What should you do if asked to show a check for your working?,Pick one of the calculations in my working out and do a reverse, It's only one mark - leave it, Write down one of my calculations again exactyl as before, Write something witty like 'I know that my addition is right' ",
	"What should you always do when calculating with amounts of money?, Be careful with the decimals - take extra care when entering amounts like £5.00; 50p and 5p into the calculator, Enter them exactly as given on the paper as the calculator knows how to deal with money amounts, Don't use decimal points as this just makes it confusing, It's OK I will be able to see easily if I made a mistake",
	"What is a good strategy before you start doing a <u>non-calculator</u> exam if you feel really nervous, Ask for some paper and spend 2 or 3 minutes writing down some times tables - these will focus your mind and be really useful to refer to later, Dive straight in as there is no time to lose, Sit and stare at the questions for a while looking for ones I know I can do easily, Fiddle with my pencil for a while and hope for inspiration",
	"What is a good strategy for long questions with a lot of steps?,Break the question down - write Step 1 - Step 2 - Step 3 (or meaningful headings) in the working out box and write my working out down under the headings, Leave it I hate long questions, Dive straight in and get writing, Miss out steps I can't do",
	"For questions with measurements what should you do?,Check the all the measurements are in the same units (don't mix CM and M in calculations), Just start working - as long as the answer is close I'll get some marks, Leave these because units confuse me, My calculator will sort it out for me",
	"When adding a list of numbers what is a good way to check your answer?, Add them up again but this time in reverse because you are less likely to make the same mistake again, I'm good at adding so I trust myself, No time to check - just move on, As long as I write down the working I will get all the marks",
	"What is a good idea to check before doing a subtraction (taking away)?, MOST of the time you will taking away a small number from a bigger number ask yourself why if this is not the case, It won't matter either way the answer will be the same, There is not enough time to think about everything, The examiner will see what I meant so don't worry",
	"Before doing a divide what should you check?, Make sure you are dividing the numbers the right way round - if you get a weird answer that is <u>way too small</u> you should try reversing the division, It won't matter either way the answer will be the same, There is not enough time to think about everything, The examiner will see what I meant so don't worry",
	"If you are asked to work out how many small things (like tiles) fit inside a large thing (like a wall) and you get a small decimal answer what should you do?, Check and reverse your division - you probably made a common mistake and had it the wrong way round, Panic and leave the rest of the question, Plough on - people quite often buy 0.00023 tiles, Put a line through the working out and start the whole question again", 
	"When asked to draw up a timing plan for some activities what do they mean?, I create a table with a row for each activity and columns for start time; end time and what the activity is, It's some kind of written description that summarises the question, Write down one line for each stage, Move on I hate timings",
	"When drawing up tables and charts what should I do?, Sketch it out on rough paper and then use a ruler and a pencil to do it properly, Use my pen and draw lines as straight as I can, Sketch it out as long as it looks close I'll get the marks, Leave this question I hate the table ones",
	"When drawing graphs or bar charts what should you always do?,Rough Sketch first then - Number axes carefully (starting from zero) - Use Pencil - Use Ruler - Title - Label Axes, Draw it roughly as they are only looking for a rough idea, Not enouh time to do everything as long as its close it will be OK, I can draw lines rather than bars as bars take too long",
	"I've been asked to design a data collection table - what should I draw?,Create a table with clear headings and enough rows and columns to enable a person to count how many of each option, Panic because I hate these table questions, Draw a graph or bar chart, Scribble down some random empty table with no headings it might get some marks",
	"When a question asks how many smaller things fit inside a larger thing I'm probably going to be:, Dividing the smaller amount into the larger amount, Using guesswork, Just multpliying things together, Some kind of addition",

		<p><u><b>Probability</u></b></p>\
<p>Probability is all about measuring the chances of something happening</p>\
<p>This can be expressed in words:</p>\
<p><b>Impossible</b>: The event can <u>never ever</u> happen</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of getting 7 when rolling a 6 sided die<p>\
<p><b>Unlikely</b>: The chance of the event happening are <u>much less</u> than it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of winning the national lottery this week<p>\
<p><b>Evens</b>: The chance of the event happening are <u>the same</u> as it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of getting HEADS when tossing a coin<p>\
<p><b>Likely</b>: The chance of the event happening <u>are more</u> than it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: The chances of getting warm sunny days sometime during summer<p>\
<p><b>Certain</b>: Event must happen - no other outcome is possible.</p>\
<p>Ex: The chances of getting either 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 when rolling a 6 sided die<p>\
<hr>\
<p><u><b>Other Ways of Expressing Probability</u></b></p>\
<p>0 or 0% or 0.0 is the same as <b>Impossible</b></p>\
<p>Any fraction less than &frac12 or percentage more than 0 and less than 50% is the same as <b>Unlikely</b></p>\
<p>&frac12 or 50% or 0.5 is the same as <b>Evens</b></p>\
<p>Any fraction more than &frac12 or percentage more than 50% and less than 100% is the same as <b>Likely</b></p>\
<p>1 or 1.0 or 100% is the same as <b>Certain</b></p>\
<hr>\
<p><u><b>Doing Probability!</u></b></p>\
<p>All questions involving probablity involve working out all the possible outcomes and then assessing the likelihood of the event you are being asked about actually happening</p>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of seeing a person with two heads on the way to college?</p>\
<p><u>Ans: Impossible - hopefully!</u></p>\
<hr>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting Heads when flipping a coin?</p>\
<p><u>Ans: Events OR 50% or &frac12; (all these mean the same thing)</u>\
<hr>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a 6 sided die?</p>\
<p>There are six outcomes here.<p>\
<p>If you are asked to mark on a scale: You are much more likely to get something other than six so you could write <b>Unlikely</b><p>\
<p>If you are asked to express as a fraction: You are looking for <b>1 out of 6</b> so you would write &frac16;<p>\
<p><u><b>Harder Probability Questions (L2)</u></b></p>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting a an even number when rolling a die?</p>\
<p>There are six outcomes here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<p>\
<p>There are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6</p>\
<p>So you are looking for 3 outcomes out of 6 so you could write Evens OR 50% OR &frac12;</p>\

		<p><u><b>Probability</u></b></p>\
<p>Probability is all about measuring the chances of something happening</p>\
<p>This can be expressed in words:</p>\
<p><b>Impossible</b>: The event can <u>never ever</u> happen</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of getting 7 when rolling a 6 sided die<p>\
<p><b>Unlikely</b>: The chance of the event happening are <u>much less</u> than it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of winning the national lottery this week<p>\
<p><b>Evens</b>: The chance of the event happening are <u>the same</u> as it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: the chances of getting HEADS when tossing a coin<p>\
<p><b>Likely</b>: The chance of the event happening <u>are more</u> than it not happening</p>\
<p>Ex: The chances of getting warm sunny days sometime during summer<p>\
<p><b>Certain</b>: Event must happen - no other outcome is possible.</p>\
<p>Ex: The chances of getting either 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 when rolling a 6 sided die<p>\
<hr>\
<p><u><b>Other Ways of Expressing Probability</u></b></p>\
<p>0 or 0% or 0.0 is the same as <b>Impossible</b></p>\
<p>Any fraction less than &frac12 or percentage more than 0 and less than 50% is the same as <b>Unlikely</b></p>\
<p>&frac12 or 50% or 0.5 is the same as <b>Evens</b></p>\
<p>Any fraction more than &frac12 or percentage more than 50% and less than 100% is the same as <b>Likely</b></p>\
<p>1 or 1.0 or 100% is the same as <b>Certain</b></p>\
<hr>\
<p><u><b>Doing Probability!</u></b></p>\
<p>All questions involving probablity involve working out all the possible outcomes and then assessing the likelihood of the event you are being asked about actually happening</p>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of seeing a person with two heads on the way to college?</p>\
<p><u>Ans: Impossible - hopefully!</u></p>\
<hr>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting Heads when flipping a coin?</p>\
<p><u>Ans: Events OR 50% or &frac12; (all these mean the same thing)</u>\
<hr>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting a 6 when rolling a 6 sided die?</p>\
<p>There are six outcomes here.<p>\
<p>If you are asked to mark on a scale: You are much more likely to get something other than six so you could write <b>Unlikely</b><p>\
<p>If you are asked to express as a fraction: You are looking for <b>1 out of 6</b> so you would write &frac16;<p>\
<p><u><b>Harder Probability Questions (L2)</u></b></p>\
<p><b>Example</b>: What is the probability of getting a an even number when rolling a die?</p>\
<p>There are six outcomes here 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<p>\
<p>There are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6</p>\
<p>So you are looking for 3 outcomes out of 6 so you could write Evens OR 50% OR &frac12;</p>\
